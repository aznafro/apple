# Old Apple Site

This page is an assignment on The Odin Project, to practice using background colors and linear gradients. In this archived Apple site, the top navigation bar uses linear gradients.

The archived site can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

My remake of the site can be found [here](https://aznafro.github.io/apple/).
